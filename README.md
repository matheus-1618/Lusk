<div align="center" style="max-width:28rem;">

## [Full Documentation and RoadMap available here](https://matheus-1618.github.io/Lusk-docs/)

Lusk is an early-stage open source tool to assist developers in their first steps into cloud computing.


With Lusk, you don't have to manage the underlying configuration of servers, subnets and DataBases.


 You just need to:

  * Create your own web application (there is a React template in **webapp/** folder);

  * Create your processing functions (AWS Lambdas functions) or use ready-made functions in the **lambda_functions** folder, which can integrate with *DataBases*, *process requests* and *more*, all behind managed API Endpoints. 

   Easy isn't?

## Build your own Lusk

* Do want to create your own Serverless Architecture Management Plataform? 

* Understand more about Cloud and IaC concepts with a hands-on tutorial? 

* Integrate another services or applications in the Lusk?
